# Supervised Machine Learning

This repository consists out of 2 projects and a management advise binding those projects together. The first project is a Regression Analysis and the second one is a Classification Analysis 

------------

Regression Analysis: 

For this project I have build several predictive models on the continuous response variable Revenue. The models used are:
 - OLS Linear Regression
 - Lasso Regression 
 - ARD (Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination)
 - KNN

------------

Classification Model:

This project consists of the following predictive models ont he binary response variable Cross-sell-success:
- LogisticRegression
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forrest 
- Gradient Boosted Machines
